# kalman-filter
Matlab code for Kalman Filter:
- Implementation using 1D linear shallow water wave code on unstaggered and staggered grid
- Comparison between ensemble kalman filter and optimal interpolation

The code uses the summation-by-parts (SBP) method to solve the wave propagation. The user could check out that code from https://bitbucket.org/sbpteam/sbplib/. Please contact us if you'd like instructions on which branch you should check out to run different features.
